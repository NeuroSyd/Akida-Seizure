This repository contains code implementations for seizure detection leveraging the BrainChip Akida neuromorphic platform. 


The models and scripts included here are designed to process, training TUH and EPILEPSIAE EEG data and identify epileptic seizure patterns in real time, utilizing Akida's event-based neural network capabilities for low-power and high-efficiency training at the edge.

This framework proposes a patient-specific approach rather than generalizable.
